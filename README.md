Experienced Developer with a demonstrated history of working in the information technology and services industries.

By day, I’m a Dynamics CRM professional, crafting robust business solutions. By night, I transform into a passionate game developer, bringing ideas to life with C++, C#, and JavaScript.

💻 Tech Stack:
• C++ (for high-performance magic)
• C# (Unity enthusiast & CRM wizard)
• JavaScript (because the web never sleeps)

🎮 Game Dev Journey:
Building immersive worlds one pixel at a time—when I’m not debugging CRM workflows.

🔧 Always Learning, Always Building.

Let’s connect and create something awesome!

Apart from my professional journey, I am a learner and enthusiastic to learn new tech.
